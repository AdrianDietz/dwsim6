function [f EoS] = fugF(EoS,T,P,mix,phase,varargin)
%Calculation of the fugacity coefficient with a new equation of
%state overloading the method of the base IdealEoS class
%Implement here the code for calculating the fugacity coefficient
%
%Parameters:
%EoS: Equation of state used for calculations
%T: Temperature(K)
%P: Pressure (K)
%mix: cMixture object
%phase: set phase = 'liq' to calculate the fugacity of a liquid phase or
%   phase = 'gas' to calculate the fugacity of a gas phase
%
%Results:
%fug: fugacity coefficient
%EoS: returns EoS used for calculations
